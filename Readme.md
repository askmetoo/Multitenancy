##What this is

This is a multitenancy experiment.
It uses autofac for dependency injection and entity code first for migrations.

##What this is not

It's more of a demo project.  Not yet ready for production (i.e. use at own expense). 

It also showcases protecting the web.config db connection string with the rsa protection cipher.
